Instructions on running a bot game:
    When beginning a new game, enter the amount of players you would like to run with
    (bots and users included), when entering the names of each player, if you want it
    to be a regular user, enter then name as usual, e.g. "john" or "bob". If you want the
    player to be a bot, enter then name with a "bot" prefix, e.g. "bot john", or "bot bob".
    (capitalisation on the prefix does not matter, and you can have multiple word names after, the
    only part that matters is it has a prefix of bot separated by a space.)
    
    Once this is done, enter which score cards you would like to use, if you're doing a game with any bots.
    It is recommended to only use scoring cards A as they base their logic on them.

    The game will the begin like normal, when a user is the current player, it will play through like a regular game, 
    and if a bot is the current player, it will complete its own turn automatically. You can scroll up to see the history of
    what the bot did in its turn.

    This system allows for any combination of bot / user games, such as user vs user games, user vs bot games, bot vs bot games, 
    with any combination of number of players to be used.
